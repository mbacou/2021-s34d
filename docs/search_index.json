The objective of this activity is to understand the operational efficiency and profitability of seed producer groups across different environments (multiple geographies, policy and regulatory systems). The farmers in the surveyed groups produce certified seeds as well as high-quality informal seeds that go through internal seed quality assurance mechanisms. We have chosen several countries that are at different stages of agricultural transformation and with varying degrees of seed systems maturity. Comparing and contrasting these seed producer clubs within and across their respective contexts can help guide development partners in designing interventions and inform policy making and seed system regulations. The analysis is split by country, with a cross-country evaluation once all survey results have been compiled. R code chunks are shown for reproducibility. library(lubridate) library(kableExtra) library(viridisLite) library(scales) library(ggplot2) library(terra) library(data.table) library(thematic) knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height=3, fig.width=5, dpi=220, fig.path=&quot;fig/&quot;, include=TRUE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE) # Default theme for plots thematic_on(&quot;transparent&quot;, &quot;#2f2f29&quot;, c(&quot;#4799b5&quot;, &quot;#e6e7e8&quot;), font_spec(c(&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;)), qualitative = alpha(c(&quot;#4799b5&quot;, &quot;#94a545&quot;, &quot;#d37d28&quot;, &quot;#403b33&quot;, &quot;#8B1E3F&quot;, &quot;#403b33&quot;), .9)) theme_def &lt;- function( base_font = &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;, base_size = 8, base_fill = &quot;transparent&quot;, ...) theme_minimal(base_size) + theme( panel.background = element_rect(fill=base_fill, color=NA), plot.background = element_rect(fill=base_fill, color=NA), legend.box.background = element_rect(fill=base_fill, color=NA), text = element_text(family=base_font, lineheight=.8), plot.subtitle = element_text(color=&quot;#4799b5&quot;, size=base_size*.9), strip.text = element_text(face=&quot;bold&quot;, hjust=0, size=base_size*.9), axis.text = element_text(size=base_size*.8) ) + theme(...) # Default theme for tables kable_def &lt;- function(...) kable_styling( bootstrap_options=c(&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;, &quot;striped&quot;, &quot;hover&quot;), font_size=14, ...)

We first look at the consolidated survey results. Notes: 1 Int’l $ = 7,473.67 VND (Vietnamese Dong) using 2020 World Bank PPP conversion rates (1 Int’l $ = 1 USD) Focus crop = rice Transportation costs are lumped into the cost of pesticides, fertilizers and harvesting. Labor costs are per hectare Inspection and certification fees are per farm (total fees for a single season). Only farmers who sell to seed centers or seed companies do incur these marketing costs.

Max. ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 Further we construct gross margin per ha margin_ha_lcu, total sales sales_ha_sh and profit margin margin_ha_sh per unit of (variable) input costs, and costs_ha_ppp, sales_ha_ppp and margin_ha_ppp in PPP terms to allow for comparisons across groups and countries. We also construct a measure of total factor productivity tfp as output per unit of input costs. Strictly speaking it is only “partial factor productivity” here because we don’t include the rental cost of land, land preparation costs, irrigation costs, and the costs of animal and mechanical implements. hh[, `:=`( margin_ha_lcu = sales_ha_lcu - costs_ha_lcu )][, `:=`( sales_ha_sh = sales_ha_lcu / costs_ha_lcu, margin_ha_sh = margin_ha_lcu / costs_ha_lcu, costs_ha_ppp = costs_ha_lcu / xrate, sales_ha_ppp = sales_ha_lcu / xrate, margin_ha_ppp = margin_ha_lcu / xrate )][, `:=`( tfp = yield_ha_kg / costs_ha_ppp )] Finally we normalize all farmer cost line items into a “long” table hh_prod_cost for charting. # Normalize production cost table hh_prod_cost &lt;- hh[, .(hhid, seeds = seed_ha_lcu, fertilizer = fert_ha_lcu, pesticides = pest_ha_lcu, transport = tran_ha_lcu, labor = labor_ha_lcu, certification = cert_lcu, labeling = yield_ha_kg * labl_kg_lcu, packaging = yield_ha_kg * pckg_kg_lcu, marketing = yield_ha_kg * mark_kg_lcu )] hh_prod_cost &lt;- melt(hh_prod_cost, id.vars=1, value.name=&quot;lcu&quot;, variable.name=&quot;category&quot;) hh_prod_cost[, `:=`( # Add shares and PPP terms share = lcu/sum(lcu, na.rm=T), ppp = lcu/xrate ), by=hhid] Note that in the current survey we are missing farm sizes (or planted acreage), so we can not directly study the effect of farm size on the per-unit costs of production and yields, or look at potential scale effects on a farmer’s efficiency and profitability. We can however study whether larger groups might have positive effects.
