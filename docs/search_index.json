The objective of this activity is to understand the operational efficiency and associated business economics of seed producer groups across different environments (multiple geographies, policy and regulatory systems). The farmers in the surveyed groups produce certified seeds as well as high-quality informal seeds that go through internal seed quality assurance mechanisms. We have chosen several countries that are in different stages of agricultural transformation, and with varying seed system maturity. Comparing and contrasting these seed producer clubs within and across their respective contexts can help guide future interventions for development partners, and inform policy making. The analysis is split by country, with a cross-country evaluation once all field results have been compiled.

We first look at the consolidated survey results. Notes: 1 Int’l $ = 7,473.67 VND (Vietnamese Dong) using 2020 World Bank PPP conversion rates (1 Int’l $ = 1 USD) Focus crop = rice Transportation costs are lumped into the cost of pesticides, fertilizers and harvesting. Labor costs are per hectare Inspection and certification fees are per farm (total fees for a single season). Only farmers who sell to seed centers or seed companies do incur these marketing costs.

We can however measure partial factor productivity as the ratio of total agricultural output to total production input (it is only partial here because the rental cost of land, land preparation costs, irrigation costs, and farm implements are missing). Furthermore we can measure a farmer’s technical efficiency along the current production frontier.
